## Overview

![screenshot](./src/img/404-shot.png)

This is a simple project where i created a beautiful responsive 404 page as my first challenge on (https://devchallenges.io/). I found it fun building this project and one reason why i build this project was to let developers know the importance of adding 404 pages to apps and websites we create for our clients. From my point of veiw i think adding 404 page is important to help users get back to the main or home page of our apps/ website incase they enter an invalid url path and also promotes good user esperience.
